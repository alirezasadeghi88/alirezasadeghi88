<h3 align="center">Java Developer</h3>
<p align="justify">
  I'm a junior Java developer with a foundational understanding of programming and a strong passion for learning. I'm actively seeking opportunities to contribute to real-world projects, collaborate with experienced developers, and grow my skills through hands-on experience. I'm highly motivated, eager to take on challenges, and open to freelance tasks, internships, or volunteer roles that help me become a better programmer every day.
